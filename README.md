# Use Authenticator Application Front End <img src="public/favicon.png" alt="header-logo" width="27px"/>

This is a **mobile-responsive web-based user authentication system.** 
Upon registration, users gain access to the system where their **assigned roles and permissions** dictate the functionalities available to them. 
For instance, a guest user is restricted from performing operations within the system and is limited to viewing details exclusively.

#### Key features of the system include,

- The Super Administrator, serving as the system's primary authority, possesses comprehensive access across all functionalities within the system.

- Registered users have the capability to assume multiple roles, each of which may entail various permissions within the system. Upon logging in, a user can view their assigned roles and associated permissions within the Profile section.

- The system accommodates an unlimited number of users and roles, ensuring scalability and adaptability to organizational needs.

- Users hold exclusive authority over changing their own passwords. However, the Super Administrator retains the ability to reset a user's password, triggering the issuance of a temporary password sent via email. The user can then employ this temporary password to reset their password securely.
